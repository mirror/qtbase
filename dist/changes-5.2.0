QtWidgets
---------

- QAbstractScrollArea now has a SizeAdjustPolicy. If it is set to AdjustToContents
  it will make use of the new protected viewportSizeHint() (binary compatible since it
  was reserved in Qt5). This function returns a suggested size based on contents.

- [QTBUG-4206] QTableView resizeToContents will now adjust to actual contents
  and not just visible area. QHeaderView::setAutoResizePrecision() has been
  introduced to control how precise the autoResize should be.

- QFileDialog::setDefaultSuffix() removes leading dot characters.

- QSizePolicy got a retainSizeWhenHidden attribute.

- QDateTimeEdit: Extended date minimum to QDate minimum

QtCore
------
- [QTBUG-30250] QTime, QDateTime:
  When calling QTime::toString(Qt::TextDate) and QTime::toString(Qt::ISODate),
  milliseconds are now included in the returned string. This also applies to
  QDateTime::toString(Qt::TextDate) and QDateTime::toString(ISODate).
